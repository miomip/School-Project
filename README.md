The code pressented is non-usable with kotlin or any other language, and won't work if ran. Im going to be using kotlin in form of .kt files to show examples and methods of logic everything else like assets and design is **NOT** going to be pressented.

if it says in the code something - something its actualy not removing something because that's writen like this Int -= Int
