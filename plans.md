# Plans for Untitled school game
My plans for this project is to make a story based game with interactions trough out and give an ascetic and mindset over the game that feels relaxing.
While this code(The code on GitHub.com) isn't usable, I will continue to update it as a way to show progress, logic and method over the game and projects alike.
I will also realise "updates" as releases on GitHub.com as a way of tracing progress and to show evolution trough out.
 
#### Plans forward
-  To create more maps
-  Create a system for lives
-  Create enemies 

#### Things I may do
- > Create a boss
- > Create a money system 
- > Write the rest of the story 


###### Ok I don't have any good jokes right now so
###### What did the lazy programmer tell his boss? "The Hello World! program is beginning to get a bit to big with all those whitespaces boss" then the boss says "Why are you so racist over white things Jack? You don't even want it in the Hello World! program!"
