My plans for this project is to make a story based game with interactions trough out and give an ascetic and mindset over the game that feels relaxing.
While this code(The code on GitHub.com) isn't usable, I will continue to update it as a way to show progress, logic and method over the game and projects alike.
I will also realise "updates" as releases on GitHub.com as a way of tracing progress and to show evolution trough out.
